# git-master

Simplify Git in VS Code! Visualize history, manage branches, and streamline workflows with intuitive commands, clear visualizations, and contextual Git actions in the editor.

# Core Features:

**Visualizations:**

- Git Graph: An interactive graph depicting the commit history of your repository. Users should be able to easily navigate through commits, see what branches they belong to, and identify potential conflicts.

- File History: Visually compare changes made to specific files across different commits. This allows users to understand how a file has evolved over time.
  Git Workflow Management:

- Simplified Staging: Provide an intuitive interface for staging and unstaging changes. This could involve drag-and-drop functionality or clear buttons for adding/removing files from the staging area.
  Easy Commits: Offer a streamlined commit creation process with options to include informative commit messages and associate them with specific issues or pull requests.
  Effortless Rebasing and Merging: Guide users through the process of rebasing and merging branches with clear instructions and visualizations. This can help avoid merge conflicts and streamline the branching workflow.

- Additional User-Friendly Features:

  - Contextual Git Actions: Integrate Git actions directly within the editor. This could involve buttons for staging/unstaging lines of code, discarding changes, or initiating a commit right from the code view.
    Interactive Code Lens: Display information about the last commit that modified a specific line of code, including the author and commit message.

  - Git Branch Management: Simplify branch creation, deletion, and switching between branches.

  - Remember:

  - VS Code Integration: Ensure your extension seamlessly integrates with the VS Code interface. Leverage the existing Source Control view and utilize VS Code's built-in Git commands.
    Customizability: Allow users to personalize the extension's behavior through settings. This could include options for customizing keyboard shortcuts or tailoring the visual appearance of the Git graph.

  - By focusing on these functionalities, you can create a valuable tool that empowers developers to handle Git with ease and confidence.
